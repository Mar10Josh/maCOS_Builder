# maCOS Builder
maCOS Builder (or macOS C# OS Builder) is a remake of COSMOS (C# Open Source Managed Operating System) for mac.
# What is it anyways?
C# and many other languages such as Javascript can make a simple operating system.
COSMOS is only for Visual Studio (with the latest version working vs2022), but maCOS is for Visual studio code too, basically you can make anything!
